## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available COVID-19 dataset (Canada)
- **Duration**: Jan 1, 2020 â€“ Jan 21, 2023
- **Key Fields**: Province, Cases, Deaths, Date, Repatriated Travellers

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Integrated and modeled multiple datasets  
- Connected relationships between fact and dimension tables  
- Created calculated fields to fix running totals  
- Built sets to exclude irrelevant categories (Canada overall, Repatriated Travellers)  
- Designed bar graphs, trend lines, and maps for analysis  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights
- Ontario and Quebec reported the **highest number of cases** (over 1M each)  
- Alberta recorded **626K cases**, with a major spike in late 2021  
- Smaller provinces (Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories) had fewer cases but still showed pandemic impact  
- Both cases and deaths followed **similar upward trends** across multiple waves  
- The last 7 days of the dataset reported **673 new cases** and **12 deaths**, proving the pandemicâ€™s continued effect  

---

## âš¡ Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Tableau showed *Canada overall* and *Repatriated Travellers* in bar charts  
  - âœ… **Solution**: Used **Sets** to exclude those categories  

- **Challenge**: Dataset stored numbers as **running totals**, causing wrong sums in Tableau  
  - âœ… **Solution**: Created a **calculated field with MAX()** to extract correct daily totals  

- **Challenge**: Tableau summed running totals across dates  
  - âœ… **Solution**: Applied a **MAX(Date) calculation** for accurate daily reporting  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
- Automate dataset refresh for real-time updates  
- Add filters for **pandemic waves** (1st, 2nd, Omicron, etc.)  
- Include **per-capita metrics** (cases/deaths per 100K) for fairer comparisons  
- Add **annotations** for major events (lockdowns, vaccine rollouts)
